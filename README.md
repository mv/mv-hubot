# Hubot

Hubot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.


# Installing Hubot

Hubot uses Node.js. In your Mac be sure to run:

	$ brew install node

To generate your local Hubot:

	$ make hubot-init


### Slack integration

Hubot will need a valid token for the Slack adapter. From your Slack account
enable Hubot integration and generate your valid token.

Configure your token in `config/slack-token.sh`:

```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    #

    # my token
	export HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=abcd-1234567890-example
	echo  $HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN
```


### AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Create your initial resources via CloudFormation:

	make create-stack


Enable `eb` deployments:

	make eb-init
	make eb-create-simple


Inside a Beanstalk environment Hubot needs the following startup code in
`package.json`:

```javascript
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node node_modules/coffee-script/bin/coffee node_modules/hubot/bin/hubot --name hubot --adapter slack"
  }
```

### Deployments

First deployment, using vanilla Hubot:

	eb use hubot-simple
	eb deploy


### Improvements

If you want to customize Hubot with plugins, add your plugin name to
`package.json`:

```javascript
  "dependencies": {
    "hubot": "^2.19.0",
    ...
    "hubot-scripts": "^2.17.2",
    "hubot-shipit": "^0.2.0",
    "hubot-slack": "^4.3.1",
    "hubot-new-plugin-comes-here": "^1.0.0"
  },
```

and deploy:

    eb deploy


To create your own scripts/plugins, add your code to `scripts/` dir and
deploy again.

    eb deploy



## Troubleshooting

To very your deployments:

	eb status   # get current environment details
	eb health   # eb system health
	eb logs     # get environment logs
	eb events   # get environment latest events
	eb console  # Open AWS Elastic Beanstalk console


To see all defined `Makefile` tasks:

	make
